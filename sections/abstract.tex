    In this work, we explore the application of fixed, low-rank tensor-train to Denoising Probabilistic Diffusion Models.
    We show the parametric noise can be modeled using Functional Tensor-Trains(FTT).
    We will also provide details on how the model can be trained using Riemannian Optimization algorithm for fixed-rank
    tensor-trains.
    The main objective is to develop a more efficient DDPM with respect to memory and training-time.
    The secondary objective is to conduct a comparative analysis to different FTT optimization methods in the context
    of DDPM.
