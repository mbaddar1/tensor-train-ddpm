Why ? OPTIMIZATION METHODS ON RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO SHAPE SPACE
https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/num/wirth/files/RiWi12.pdf
"Even if an embedding is known, one might hope that a
Riemannian optimization method performs more efficiently since it exploits the underlying geometric structure of the
manifold. For this purpose, various methods have been devised, from simple gradient descent on manifolds [25] to
sophisticated trust region methods [5]."
